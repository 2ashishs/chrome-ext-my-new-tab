# Chrome Extension for My New Tab Page

### Problem

Often I end up with lots of open tab pages in Chrome, losing track of which ones were impotrant to me.

### Solution

This Chrome Extension adds an icon in the extension bar, which I can click to save that link to a `list of links`.
The `list of links` is my new tab page.
I can also add a link on my new tab page.
Finally, I can `export` all the links as a `JSON` file, edit the `JSON` file, send it to a friend (who uses this extension) who can `import` the links on to his new tab page.

### How to use

1. Clone the repo
2. Goto chrome://extensions
3. Enable `Developer mode` switch on the top right corner
4. Click on `Load unpacked` button on top left and select the repo folder.
